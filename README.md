# HTML & CSS Capstone Project

> In this project, I was supposed to take inspiration from [this](https://www.behance.net/gallery/29845175/CC-Global-Summit-2015) demo of a conference site. I decided to build a site announcing an upcoming play and live panel discussion with an interesting title and a rather recognizable theme for anyone checking this project out in 2020. I used Sass to compile the CSS, Bootstrap for most of the responsiveness, and CSS Grid and Flexbox to make some of the more intricate layouts easier. I hope you enjoy what I came up with!
